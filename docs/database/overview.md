# Overview

The Open Stober Database is a open database about St√∂ber synthesis of silica nanoparticles works (including particle diameters, their dispersion and the experimental conditions that led to those results).

Our goal is to promote open research of silica nanoparticles (NPs), synthesized by the Stober method.

This database aims to be used in new studies, such as statistical and machine learning models to guide the design and synthesis of calibrated and monodispersed silica NPs.

We also aim at building a community of contributors of new synthesis data to enrich its research, towards a better understaning of Stober process.

Our long-term vision is that the nanosynthesis research community opens and shares its data as this will advance the nanosynthesis field in a more sustainable way globally.
